Thank you for installing IPMan - IPSec Connection Manager!

The IPMan operator has been deployed to your cluster and is ready to manage IPSec connections.

To get started:

1. Create a secret with your pre-shared key:
   kubectl create secret generic ipsec-secret -n default --from-literal=example=yourpresharedkey

2. Create an IPSecConnection custom resource:
   kubectl apply -f your-ipsec-connection.yaml

3. Check the status of your IPSecConnection:
   kubectl get ipsecconnection -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}
   kubectl describe ipsecconnection your-connection-name -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

4. When deploying workloads that need to use the VPN connection, add the required annotations:
   - ipman.dialo.ai/childName: "your-child-name"
   - ipman.dialo.ai/ipmanName: "your-connection-name"
   - ipman.dialo.ai/poolName: "your-pool-name"

For more information, please refer to the README.md or documentation.

IMPORTANT: Make sure your worker pods/deployments have the correct annotations to use the IPSec tunnel.
